### Multiple-Dose Simulation

<span style="color:lightblue">PMx w/ Python</span> | 
<span style="color:lightblue">PKPD Simulation </span>*

Multiple-dose PKPD simulation offers valuable insights into the behavior of drugs within the body over time and their corresponding effects. In this notebook, I wish to replicate the example in [Introduction to RxODE](https://nlmixrdevelopment.github.io/RxODE/articles/RxODE-intro.html) with self-written python functions based on [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), and I MADE IT! The entire process is exciting and rewarding, resulting in a couple of useful functions for multiple-dose PKPD data simulation.

D-optimal design is a method for selecting the most efficient experimental design based on the Fisher information matrix. By replicating the warfarin example using Python, this project will help to better understand the concepts involved in optimal design, such as Fisher information matrix and D-optimal criterion.

### Taylor Series Approximation
*<span style="color:lightblue">Pharmacometrics</span> | 
<span style="color:lightblue">First Order Approximation</span> | 
<span style="color:lightblue">Laplacian Approximation</span>*

In the realm of pharmacometrics, approximations are often the unsung heroes. They allow us to tackle complex problems with simplified models, saving time and resources while still yielding valuable insights. We'll delve into two powerful players: First-Order Approximation and Laplacian Approximation.
